7.personal data <br>

As part of processing your personal data for the purposes set out above, Coinfigo may disclose your personal data to any members of the Coinfigo company group, and to third parties. For example, Coinfigo may disclose your personal data to any of our service providers and business partners, for business or other legitimate purposes, such as specialist advisors who have been contracted to provide us with administrative, financial, legal, tax, compliance, insurance, IT, debt-recovery, analytics, research or other services.
If Coinfigo discloses your personal data to service providers and business partners, 
in order to perform the services requested by clients or to comply with our legal and 
regulatory obligations, such providers and partners may store your personal data within their own systems.
 We require them to protect the confidentiality of this personal data, and comply with all relevant privacy and data protection laws.<br>
 
8. Where we store your personal data<br>

Our operations are supported by a network of computers, servers, other infrastructure and information technology, 
and third-party service providers. We and our third-party service providers and business partners store 
and process your personal data in the European Union, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States of 
America and elsewhere in the world. Courts, law enforcement and security agencies of these jurisdictions 
may be able to use legal processes to access your personal data.<br>
 
9. For UK & EEA clients: <br>Transfers of personal  data outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK)

We may transfer your personal data outside the EEA and UK to other Coinfigo  group companies, service providers and business partners. Transfers outside of the EEA or the UK (as appropriate) shall be in accordance with lawful transfer mechanisms. If personal data is transferred to a country which has been found by the European Commission to have an essentially equivalent standard of data protection to the EEA, then Kraken may rely on an ‘adequacy decision’ to transfer that personal data. See herefor a list of countries with adequacy decisions. If personal data is transferred from the EEA or UK to the US, we may rely on standard contractual clauses. 
 
10. Privacy when using digital assets and blockchains

Your use of digital assets may be recorded on a public blockchain. Public blockchains are distributed ledgers, intended to immutably record transactions across wide networks of computer systems. Many blockchains are open to forensic analysis which can lead to re-identification of transacting individuals and the revelation of personal data, especially when blockchain data is combined with other data.
As blockchains are decentralized or third-party networks which are not controlled or operated by Coinfigo and, we are not able to erase, modify, or alter personal data on such networks.
 
11. Data retention<br>

When personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it may lawfully be processed, 
we will remove any details that will identify you, or we will securely destroy the relevant records. 
We may need to maintain records for a significant period of time after you cease being our client for 
legal or regulatory reasons, for example when we need to retain information to help manage a dispute or legal claim. <br>
Additionally, we are subject to certain anti-money laundering laws which may require us to retain the following for a period (e.g., 5 years)
 after our business relationship with you has ended:<br>
 
• A copy of the records we used in order to comply with our client due diligence obligations;
• Supporting evidence and records of transactions with you, and your relationship with us.
If you have opted out of receiving marketing communications we will hold your details on our suppression list so that we know you do not want to receive these communications.
We may keep your personal data for longer than 5 years if we cannot delete it for legal, regulatory, or technical reasons.<br>

Access:
You can ask us to confirm whether we are processing your personal data and, if so, what information we process and to provide you with a copy of that information.<br>

Rectification:<br>
It is important to us that your personal data is up to date. We will take all reasonable steps to make sure that your personal data remains accurate, complete and up-to-date. Please inform us if your personal data changes. If the personal data we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you are entitled to have it rectified.

such as if you contest the accuracy of that personal data or object to us processing it. 
It will not stop us from storing your personal data. If we have disclosed your personal data to others,

• Processing your personal data for research unless we reasonably believe such 
processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest (such as by a regulatory or enforcement agency).<br><br>

an automated process (e.g. through automatic profiling) that affects your ability to access our

decision unless we can demonstrate to you that such decision is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, 
a contract between you and us. Even if a decision is necessary for entering into or performing a contract, 
you may contest the decision and require human intervention. We may not be able to offer our products or services to you,
 if we agree to such a request (i.e. end our relationship with you).<br><br>

Complaints:<br>
